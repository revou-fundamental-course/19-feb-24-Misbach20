                 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Story</h2>
                 <p style="text-align: center;">With a humble beginning of a comment section and 
                    forum, Female Daily community - with members that were considered to be early 
                    beauty adopters - grew into one of the biggest women-centered community in Indonesia.
                     It then evolved into the first beauty review platform in Indonesia, establishing itself as
                      top-of-mind in beauty.
                    In 2017 Female Daily brought the community, brands and other beauty players together 
                    in JakartaXBeauty with a staggering 15.000+ visitors, further solidifying its position
                     at the forefront in beauty. 2020 marked another milestone as Female Daily Studio was 
                     launched,completing the cycle.</p>
